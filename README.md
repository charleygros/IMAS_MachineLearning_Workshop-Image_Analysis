# IMAS workshop - Image analysis with deep learning

This repository contains material for the IMAS workshop (31/08/2021) focusing on image analysis using deep learning:
- a slide presentation going through my personal voyage in the Deep Learning world, and some recently proposed and exciting approaches
- an image dataset from "Where is Wally?"
- some code to train a model aiming at automatically detecting Wally on images. In particular, a Jupyter notebook ("code/practice.ipynb") is provided to go though the training and inference steps. It can be opened with Google Collab.

### Acknowledgments

Merci Andreanne Lemay for her support in my Wally quest. Merci Julien Cohen-Adad for encouraging me to engage myself in the Deep Learning voyage and for supporting me in so many ways along the way.
